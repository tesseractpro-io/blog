# The Tesseract Pro Ecosystem

Tesseract Pro holds a unique position; we possess an exceptional platform accompanied by vast amounts of data. As of the time of writing, we have over 50GB of market data spanning multiple markets and years. Additionally, our users have manually annotated millions of data points in the form of Markers and Turning points.

# AI models

AI models operate on the basis of learning patterns and making predictions or decisions based on data. At their core, these models employ algorithms that iteratively process input data to identify underlying patterns and relationships. The process involves training the model on a labeled dataset, where it learns to recognize patterns through repeated exposure to examples. Once trained, the model can generalize its understanding to make predictions or decisions on new, unseen data.

Using all the data from Tesseract Pro, I have been able to build and train multiple models which are being used forecast the next turning points and their confidence score ranging from 0% to 100%. I use a approach that is called *model stacking*. In this technique, the predictions and outputs are combined to generate the final prediction.

In the following screenshot you see multiple circles displayed on screen, this is where the AI model has predicted the next turning points will be.
